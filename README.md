# Rezeipt Mobile Application

Rezeipt Mobile Application is an application that can scan QR code to retrieve e-receipts, store the e-receipts, show purchase analytics and redeem points. This application is used by customers from stores that are using Rezeipt Web Application which is a store management system used by the admin and store employees.

This application is developed with the use of React Native and Node.js technologies with MySQL as the database management system. 

Rezeipt Mobile Application is a final year project developed together with my team member, Sharifah Nur Asilah.
